## Overview

This repository contains a Python notebook and supporting materials for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focused on a TikTok dataset. The project aims to understand user behavior, content characteristics, and engagement patterns on the platform, with a specific emphasis on distinguishing between videos categorized as "claim" versus "opinion." This project is part of a larger effort to gather actionable insights that can drive business decisions. Dataset source: [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/go-beyond-the-numbers-translate-data-into-insight).

## Key Objectives

*   **Data Exploration:** Inspect and clean a TikTok dataset, addressing missing values and outliers.
*   **Data Visualization:** Create a range of visualizations (box plots, histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, and pie charts) using Python's `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `pandas` libraries to identify key trends and patterns within the data.
*   **Outlier Analysis:** Investigate the presence of outliers in video engagement metrics and analyze their impact on data.
*   **Tableau Integration:** Create a Tableau dashboard to present key findings and visualizations in an accessible and shareable format.
*   **Actionable Recommendations:** Generate evidence-based recommendations to enhance the platform and guide future actions.

## Content

*   `tiktok_dataset.csv`: The raw dataset used for this analysis.
*   `notebook.ipynb`: A Python Jupyter Notebook containing all code, analysis, and visualizations.

## Analysis Areas

The analysis explores key variables such as:

*   `claim_status` (claim vs. opinion)
*   `verified_status` (verified vs. not verified)
*   `author_ban_status` (active, under review, banned)
*   Video engagement metrics (`video_view_count`, `video_like_count`, etc.)
